Are you looking for something extraordinary? 🎵 Catch a list of cool music videos created by neural networks (+bonus at the end) ⬇️

AI is a great finding for fans who, inspired by their favorite tracks, can now create atmospheric clips on them themselves. After all, it’s so simple: I typed in the lyrics of the song, and the neural network generates the art itself. It remains only to mount them correctly.

⭐ And often really good works are obtained. For example, like director Tristan Jones, who, with the help of MidJourney, created a clip for Disturbed from more than 10,000 art for their song Bad Man.

And here is a selection of 7 more interesting clips created by enthusiasts in a duet with neural networks based on song lyrics:

◀️[Michael Jackson — Thriller](https://youtu.be/uh1l3mlNm7A)

◀️[Nirvana — Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://youtu.be/fT6zD9ysGbY)

◀️[Queen — Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_VYGvHpED8)

◀️[Coolio — Gangsta’s Paradise](https://youtu.be/MRvL4Z_7OlA)

◀️[Linkin Park — In The End](https://youtu.be/BH7ly1cO84E)

◀️[Imagine Dragons — Radioactive](https://youtu.be/FdEwzCbCE4M)

◀️[Survivor — Eye Of The Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgXGT7InMmk)

And, as promised, a bonus:

🔥A six — minute film about the AI uprising — “[The Safe Zone](https://youtu.be/OA8-6q7igwE)”. The ChatGPT neural network was fully responsible for writing the script and storyboard, as well as instructions for the film crew. This is the first short film directed by a neural network.
