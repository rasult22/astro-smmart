The validity of neural networks! Today books written by AI will not surprise anyone anymore 😯

We have collected a list of several interesting, in our opinion, works created by neural networks:

🦋 “Aum Golly: Poems of Artificial Intelligence about Humanity” is a collection of poems written in just 24 hours by the efforts of GPT — 3 at the request of Finnish writer Jukka Aalho. The titles, themes, and texts of the poems were generated by the AI itself.

🦋 “The World of Sybil: AI is rethinking itself and its world with the help of GPT-3” — the result of a collaboration of the author (Mark Strassman), editor (Fred Zimmerman) and neural network (GPT-3). Mark and Fred “asked” the chatbot Sybil to write a book about themselves and it turned out very interesting.

🦋 “Trying to Wake Up” is a collection of short stories created by the ruGPT — 3 neural network in collaboration with writer and artist Pavel Pepperstein: 50% of the texts are written by Pavel himself, and 50% are the merit of AI trained on his stories. So there was an interesting symbiosis of the author and his neurodeveloper,

🦋 “Moon Wars” is a LitRPG written by AI and edited by Paul Bellow, a writer and AI developer. According to the plot of the neural network and Gender, the reader on behalf of an ordinary young gamer Alex will have to save the Universe.

🦋 “Autonomous Haiku Machine” is a collection of poems written by GPT-3 in the haiku genre (a traditional Japanese form of poetry). The poems are generated entirely by a neural network, without human intervention. The texts turned out to be as simple as possible in structure, but at the same time filled with deep meaning.

As you have noticed, neural networks can create in different styles and produce works in any form.

We will continue to please you from time to time with our collections of good by AI. So follow our hashtag #SMMartList 😎
