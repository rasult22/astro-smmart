A selection of neural networks that can create cool original images 🔥🔥🔥

⭐️DALL-E 2 is probably already familiar to everyone, a neural network. To take advantage of its benefits, you need to create an account. After no preimum access, you get access to 50 attempts to generate images. Next — your limit per month is 15 free images.

Craiyon, originally called Dall-E mini, is a simplified version of its older sister Dall-E 2. But it is freely available.

⭐️Dream by Wombo also creates unique art according to the text parameters you set and in the selected styles, but only in vertical format. For example, for stories or wallpapers on a smartphone.

⭐️ThisPersonDoesNotExist is a resource that gives you a realistic photo of a non — existent person. Each time the page is updated, a new portrait is created based on photos of people from the network.

⭐️This Cat Does Not Exist. We think it’s not so difficult to guess by the name how this AI differs from the one mentioned above.

Looka will help you automatically generate a minimalistic logo for your company and see how it will look on the website or on a business card.

Midjourney is the very neural network that excites the entire Internet with its art. However, to use it, you need an acc in the Discord messenger. And without a paid subscription, you have a limit of 25 requests.
