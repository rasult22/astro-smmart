Great news for book lovers: Apple has started using AI to create audiobooks üéß

And this is not just voicing the text with a robotic voice, but almost a real narrative, since the digital storyteller is trained on the basis of human voice and intonation.

In Apple Books, books voiced by the neural network will be designated as ‚ÄúNarrated by Apple Books‚Äù.

The use of an AI tool in this area will significantly expand the catalog of audiobooks, which cannot but please both readers and the authors themselves.

It seems that we are on the verge of the emergence of a new trend üî•
