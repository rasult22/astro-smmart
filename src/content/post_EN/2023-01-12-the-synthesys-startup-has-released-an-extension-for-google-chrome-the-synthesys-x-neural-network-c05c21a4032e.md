The Synthesys startup has released an extension for Google Chrome — the Synthesys X neural network , which generates images in a couple of mouse clicks right in the browser itself 🌎

How does it work? After installing the extension in your Chrome, you just need to right-click on the image you like opened in the browser and select “Revisualize this image” from the context menu that appears.

Apparently, Synthesis X itself determines the promt of the selected image and creates a new image based on it.

So far, the extension copes only with simple tasks and sometimes gives an error, but we will monitor how things will develop with the neural network further! 😎
