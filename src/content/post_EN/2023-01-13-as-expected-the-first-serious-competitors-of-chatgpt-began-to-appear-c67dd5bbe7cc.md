As expected, the first serious competitors of ChatGPT began to appear âœ…

The Claude chatbot from the startup Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees, is still at the pre-release stage, in closed beta testing, but reviews of generally satisfied users have already begun to flash on the network.

The Claude neural product is another implementation of the language prediction model, which is trained on texts from the network. He is learning, apparently, quite smartly.

Anthropic, of course, plan to pump Claude further and, hopefully, soon a wider range of users will be able to test his capabilities.

It would be interesting to arrange a battle Claude vs ChatGPT ðŸ’š

In the meantime, it remains only to rely on the feedback of beta testers. For example, Jan Dubois, a graduate student at Stanfordâ€™s AI Lab, noticed that Claude, compared to ChatGPT, often answers closer to the topic, but at the same time is less concise.

In addition, unlike ChatGPT, Claude can sometimes even admit that he does not know the answer to the question.

We will observe the development of Claude further. And wait for the releases of new strong rivals ChatGPT ðŸ•º
