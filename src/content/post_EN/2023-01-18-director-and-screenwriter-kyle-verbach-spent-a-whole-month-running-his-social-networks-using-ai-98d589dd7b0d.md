Director and screenwriter Kyle Verbach spent a whole month running his social networks using AI, and none of his friends noticed it ü´•

The guy created his photos using Stable Diffusion. This is a neural network that generates images based on text queries. It has an open source, so after installing Stable Diffusion on your computer, you can use your own computing power for more convincing results.

This is what Kyle took advantage of, starting his experiment with a length of almost 30 days. Stable Diffusion helped him generate realistic photos of trips, events and meetings that never happened to Kyle. That is, together with And he literally created a fake life for himself, and friends liked, commented and suspected nothing!

In his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRClNMC_z-s), Kyle shares the details of the technical implementation and the emotional component of the experiment. Be sure to take a look ‚ö°Ô∏è

Once again, it‚Äôs impressive how neural networks manage to create fake, but such plausible things, right? ‚ùï
