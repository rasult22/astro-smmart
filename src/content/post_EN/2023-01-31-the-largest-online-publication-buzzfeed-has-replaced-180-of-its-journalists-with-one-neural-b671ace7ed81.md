The largest online publication Buzzfeed has replaced 180 of its journalists with‚Ä¶ one neural network üòê

At first, like many other companies, BuzzFeed, citing the deteriorating economic situation, cut 12% of its employees, and these are exactly the same 180 people.

Later, the publication‚Äôs management announced that it would begin using AI capabilities to create content. For example, the well-known ChatGPT will be involved in writing texts.

The chatbot will start with personalized tests and quizzes for now, and gradually it is planned to introduce it into other editorial processes.

At the same time, it is emphasized that people will continue to play their role in providing BuzzFeed with ‚Äúcultural currency‚Äù and ‚Äúinspirational tips.‚Äù As well as the fact that the publication will remain focused on journalistic materials created by people.

Well, we‚Äôll see how things go on.

And yes. It seems that we were a little hasty with optimistic statements in the previous post üò≥
