Product placement. Virtual product placement. And all thanks to the help of AI ü§î

IT entrepreneur Omar Tavakol presented his startup, which will allow advertising to be implemented not only in films or TV series, but also, for example, in interviews or a video podcast on YouTube.

Rembrand is an AI ‚Äî based platform that creates a virtual model of the advertised product (for example, a jar of energy), and then adds it to absolutely any video (for example, on the desktop of a movie character or on the shelves behind the interviewer).

This way of promoting products is more effective, because we all, frankly, squander ordinary commercials, right? üëç

How do these AI problems differ from the usual product placement? In addition to saving time and money on the distribution of physical copies of the product, it is also dynamic and adaptable. üíÉ That is, look: thanks to Rembrand, the advertised objects can be added after the shooting of the video, and they can also be easily edited after direct integration.

This is very helpful when the shooting is delayed (sometimes for more than one year), and the implemented product placement loses relevance after the expiration of time. Do you remember the story with ‚ÄúNo time to Die‚Äù about Bond?

The film was supposed to be released in 2019, but first there was a problem with the director, then with the pandemic. And the third time the premiere was postponed because of‚Ä¶ Nokia models that have been outdated over the years are in the hands of characters. So I had to reshoot some scenes.

And with AI Rembrand, such problems, in theory, can be easily avoided. Even add to Craig‚Äôs hands a jar of energy invented by us for an example.

Of course, let‚Äôs see how this will work in Hollywood (and not only) in practice. In the meantime, it sounds and looks impressive üö¨
