## We are sharing with you this Friday a new pack of utilities: AI, which will help a lot in resolving workflows 👏😇

⭐️ Durable is a neural network constructor that will generate a one — page website in a matter of seconds: you only need to choose the scope of your activity and specify the brand name.

Otter — can record conversations on your business calls in real time in Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. A very useful thing, so that you don’t have to worry about the protocol of the meeting later. And it can also be safely used to translate webinars and interviews into text.

Puzzle — based on the content you have imported, it quickly compiles a glossary that gives clear and concise definitions of the key terms and concepts of your brand.

Inkforall — generates graphics, pictures and various visual materials based on text scripts, and also knows how to write the texts themselves.

Deepl is an AI translator that perfectly copes with its tasks and supports 25 languages. The creators claim that their brainchild captures even the most subtle tonalities of meanings and meanings in order to translate them as accurately as possible later.
