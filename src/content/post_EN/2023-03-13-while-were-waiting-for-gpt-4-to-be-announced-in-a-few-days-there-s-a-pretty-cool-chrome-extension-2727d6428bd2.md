While we‚Äôre waiting for GPT-4 to be announced in a few days, there‚Äôs a pretty cool Chrome extension called GPT-EZ üíª

What kind of features does it give you when using ChatGPT? üí°

You can customize your chat room with the neural network: for example, choose one of the available color themes.

Download ChatGPT discussion threads or just ChatGPT answers straight into docks ‚Äî PNG, PDF, DOC, MD. You can also share your dialogs with friends or subscribers through a link or anonymously.

You can choose the language in which AI will respond. Include a word/character counter if necessary, and also add buttons ‚Äúcopy‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù after each answer of the neural network. All for the convenience of lazy leather üòÇ

Developers promise to bring a few more useful things later. But let‚Äôs see what they prepared for us in new version of GPT-4, which, judging by loud statements, will be 537 times cooler than the previous one. And how it will reflect in practice on our favorite chatbot.

In general, they say, GPT-4 will generate not only text but also vidosikis, pictures and even music. So we diligently wait for March 16, I‚Äôm very curious to see it all üòè
