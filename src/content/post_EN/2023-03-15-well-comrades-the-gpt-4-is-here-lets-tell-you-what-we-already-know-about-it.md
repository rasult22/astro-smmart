Well, comrades, the GPT-4 is here! Let’s tell you what we already know about it ❤️‍🔥.

According to OpenAI, it’s more robust, creative and can handle finer instructions than GPT-3.5.

🔥 Recognizes what’s shown in photos and pictures. At the same time understands what’s going on in them. So it can, for example, explain the meaning of a meme.

🔥 Can analyze text up to 25 thousand characters.

🔥 Trained to write code in all major languages.

🔥 Responds 82% less often to forbidden content queries and 40% more often to useful answers.

At the presentation, the presenter showed all the power of the new version live. For example, GPT-4 calculated a complicated tax for a married couple and also helped to create a bot for Discord in two minutes, fixing all the bugs by herself. And then she looked at a blurry picture of a website design sketched out on a piece of paper and produced the code for it.

You can already join the waiting list. And ChatGPT Plus subscribers already got a chance to check out GPT-4 in person 😎
