JoÃ£o FerrÃ£o dos Santos, an engineer and marketer from Portugal, has launched a new challenge, the progress of which can be watched on his LinkedIn page.

The enthusiast, as an experiment, asked GPT-4 to come up with a company with a starting capital of 1,000 USD, then gave the chatbot all the reins of government, and he decided to devote only an hour a day to the development of the brand.

ChatGPT came up with an online store selling eco-T-shirts with the cool name AIsthetic Apparel and rolled out a 10-step business plan for its development. The graphics for T â€” shirts were taken over by another AI â€” Midjourney, according to ChatGPTâ€™s own recipes. And, also, the nimble neuroSEO advised his leather assistant to attract capital from independent investors. Those were quickly found: in exchange for a quarter of the companyâ€™s shares, they offered 2,500 USD.

Sales of T-shirts started on the 4th day of the experiment. The case has significantly expanded, offers for cooperation, PR and franchise began to arrive. And by the ninth day (in 5 days of sales), AIsthetics Apparelâ€™s revenue had grown to 10,000 USD.

We stock up on popcorn and follow the progress of the experiment further! Apparently, such cases will blow up our news feed more than once ðŸ‘€
