description: In this article, Google engineer Jeff Delaney explains how he connected GPT-4 to his brain using a neurointerface called Neurosis. Jeff trained Neurosis to recognize a thought when he thinks about a lemon and developed a JavaScript program that binds this thought to a specific command and directs a specific request directly to the neural network. The post highlights the potential of this technology in various fields, such as medicine, education, and entertainment, and showcases the future of science fiction movies. Learn more about the power of thought and AI technology in this article.

## The power of thought: the developer connected GPT-4 to‚Ä¶ his brain! üòè

Google engineer Jeff Delaney explains in detail on his Fireship youtube channel how you can submit chatGPT requests using the neurointerface.

Neurosis is a device that translates brain signals into numerical representation. Jeff made the most of this opportunity: he trained Neurosis to recognize a thought when he thinks about a lemon. And he also developed a JavaScript program that binds this thought to a specific command and directs a specific request directly to the neural network.

How does it work? You‚Äôre sitting on a date, everything‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre chatting sweetly, and then you decide to make a joke to hit the girl with your wit. You think about sour ‚Äî and voila! ü•≥ ‚Äî GPT-4 generates a joke for you.

There are dozens of variants of thought triggers and reaction commands. Just imagine what prospects open up in medicine, in education, and even in the field of entertainment, if you twist this thing?

The future of science fiction movies is even closer than we thought üëè
