Each of the 25 characters has its own personality and memories, and they live their own lives, building relationships, making career choices, and even showing interest in politics. The experiment showcases the potential of AI in imitating human behavior and creating simulations that resemble real life.

The guys-scientists from Stanford have created a virtual town of Smallville, inhabited by 25 characters, each of which has its own character, and also memories. That is, a person. But the most interesting thing is that each of the NPCs is controlled by artificial intelligence based on ChatGPT.

And so in Smallville, everything is like in the Sims game ‚Äî the characters live their own lives. Only they don‚Äôt just cook breakfast, go to work and interact with each other, but also create new relationships themselves, coordinate their own actions, reflect and even organize joint parties.

Why did you start this experiment? The researchers just wanted to see how well AI would cope with the imitation of human behavior. And along the way, the characters demonstrated their independence well: they made a career, built relationships and even showed interest in politics. Of course, it was not without difficulties: sometimes an NPC broke into a closed store or went to drink beer at lunch instead of a coffee shop. But, as it seems to us, such moments only bring them closer to living people.

In the future, it is planned to open interaction with NPCs for users, but for now you can only observe the life of Smallville as third-party observers. And wait for similar neuromechanics to be introduced into other games üèÜ

However, we can take advantage of some cool artificial intelligence chips right now. For example, with [SMMart](https://www.smm.art/), you can generate unique content for your social networks right on the go. Take a look at our website and find out how AI can make your life easier today.
