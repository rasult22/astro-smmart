The artificial intelligence-generated banger Drake and The Weeknd has been viral on the web and has collected millions of auditions in just a few days.

However, the management of Universal Music Group criticized the creation of neural networks, claiming copyright infringement. And now the track is already being actively removed from all official sites.

According to the user with the nickname Ghostwriter977, who uploaded the track to the Internet, “Heart on My Sleeve”, was almost completely created using AI: first neural networks wrote the lyrics for the song, after artificial intelligence generated the voices of Drake and Weekend. It remained only to process the result with autotune and apply a bit.

The opinions of listeners about the creation of neural networks were divided: someone went in, and someone caught a cringe — the voices processed by artificial intelligence sound so unnatural for them. Still others began to fantasize about what the future Spotify would look like with neural networks embedded in it. And they expressed a curious version: it’s cool if users can choose not only the song themselves, but also the star whose voice it will be performed by.

So we sit and think, what other surprises is artificial intelligence preparing for the music world? And I wonder how the Universal Music Group’s hit on the neural network will be resolved? After all, the topic of copyright infringement by artificial intelligence has resurfaced in the air.

We’re stocking up on popcorn and getting ready to replenish our playlists. The neurotrack from The Weeknd and Drake was not the first and definitely not the last.

After all, AI is no longer just a tool, but a full-fledged co-author. By the way, if you are interested in trying out the AI capabilities for your business in practice, visit our [SMMart ](https://www.smm.art/)website.
