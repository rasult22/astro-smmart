28-year-old Svetlana from New York categorically disagreed with the decision of the owner of her rented housing to raise the rent.

Initially, the girl, because of the washing machine that has not been working for 2 years, asked to reduce the fee, but the harmful landlord in response sent a notification of her increase by 0.4%: from $ 1,389 to $ 1,395.

Then Svetlana called for the help of the power of artificial intelligence. I asked the neural network to write a competent letter on behalf of a lawyer, supported by clear arguments and references to the laws. And the chat bot ChatGPT coped!

As a result, the girl continues to pay at the old rate, and the villain, defeated by the power of the neural network, finally fixed the washing machine at his own expense.

This is not the first time when artificial intelligence acts as an assistant in resolving legal disputes. Do you remember when we wrote about the DoNotPay startup project ‚Äî a neural network lawyer?

But it‚Äôs ironic that the developer of an AI lawyer could not fend off the claims of real lawyers. Those were alarmed by the appearance of artificial intelligence in the arena, capable of replacing them in their work. Therefore, the neural network was not allowed to be used for defense in court, and the idea of an AI lawyer had to be abandoned.

But Svetlana‚Äôs case proves once again that neural networks are a cool tool if there are no funds to consult a living lawyer‚ö°Ô∏è
