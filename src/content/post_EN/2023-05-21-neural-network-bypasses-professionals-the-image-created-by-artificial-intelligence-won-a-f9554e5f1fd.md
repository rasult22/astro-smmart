Recently, German photographer Boris Eldagsen won the Sony World Photography Awards 2023 international photo contest, but he did it for the sake of public discourse. Therefore, he refused the $5,000 reward.

He admitted that the black-and-white picture of the two women was created with the help of artificial intelligence. Eldagsen deliberately sent this particular work to the competition in order to test the jury‚Äôs readiness for the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of AI in the world of photography with such a provocative experiment and stimulate discussion of this topical topic.

By the way, representatives of Sony World Photography Awards were aware in advance that Eldagsen used artificial intelligence when creating his picture. It‚Äôs just that the nomination in which the work was presented implied the use of innovative and experimental techniques, which includes neural networks.

But the question was raised interesting, of course. And logical. Can AI-generated creativity compete with the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù creativity we are used to?

After all, neural networks are already being actively implemented not only in the field of science, but also in creativity, business, and many other areas. Are we really ready for the ‚Äùinvasion‚Äù of AI?

For example, are you ready to use all the advantages that artificial intelligence offers for your business? If the answer is positive, then be sure to visit our [SMMart ](https://www.smm.art/)website.

Make sure that neural networks can work for you, helping to effectively promote your product on social networks.
