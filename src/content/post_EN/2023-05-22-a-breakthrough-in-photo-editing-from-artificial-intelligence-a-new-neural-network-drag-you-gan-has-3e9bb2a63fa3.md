description: This article discusses the announcement of a new neural network called Drag You GAN, which allows for accurate pixel control in image deformation and editing. The article suggests that Drag You GAN may be the Photoshop of the future, enabling users to easily change the pose, shape, and expression of objects in photos. The project is still in development, but the developers plan to publish the AI source code in June. The article promotes SMMart, an AI system that helps businesses promote their products and services on social media, and highlights the potential of AI in photo editing. Learn more about Drag You GAN and the future of AI in this article.

AI in a couple of clicks allows you to deform images with the most accurate control of the location of pixels. What is it if not Photoshop of the future?

That is, you can easily and simply change the pose or shape of the object in the photo, play with the expression of a personâ€™s face, the angle of the landscape and much more. You redach quickly, and the neural network completes the missing details itself.

The project is still in development, and the developers promised to publish the AI source code in June. So we are waiting for a chance to test the full power of Drag You GAN in practice. In the meantime, we are just admiring the neural network capabilities stated in the demo videos.
