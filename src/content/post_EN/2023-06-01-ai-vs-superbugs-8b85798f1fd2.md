Recently, the results of an interesting study were published in the scientific journal Nature Chemical Biology. A group of scientists using algorithms of trained artificial intelligence identified a new antibiotic abaucin, which destroys a deadly type of superbugs.

In general, one of the difficulties in creating antibiotics is associated with the continuous mutation and adaptation of bacteria to medicines. However, using a machine learning model, scientists were able to quickly investigate medicinal compounds and identify those that can effectively fight Acinetobacter baumannii. This is exactly the type of bacteria classified by WHO as the number one enemy of humanity and causing up to 80% of infections.

As a result, in just a few hours of work, the AI identified hundreds of potential candidates, from which 240 were selected for further analysis. This approach led to the creation of nine new antibiotics, among which abaucin proved to be the most effective.

That is, the use of artificial intelligence has significantly accelerated the process of transition to clinical trials. And this is a significant breakthrough in medicine, which is good news.

In addition, they say that the first antibiotics developed with the involvement of AI will be available by 2030 ðŸ”¥

The role of artificial intelligence in the modern world continues to grow and is no longer limited to scientific research. For example, today you can experience all the advantages of AI to promote your business.
