description: This article discusses the introduction of a multimodal neural network ImageBind by Meta, which can process 6 types of data at once, including text, pictures, sounds, depth maps, heat maps, and IMU signals. The article explains that the neural network connects objects and phenomena in photos and videos with how they may sound, how warm or cold they are, how they move, and how they are located in three-dimensional space. The article suggests that the long-term goal is to teach ImageBind to process even more sensory information, including touch, speech, smell, and brain signals. The article also promotes SMMart, an AI system that generates full-fledged posts for social networks using neural networks.

The revolutionary neural network, according to the creators, can process 6 types of data at once. ImageBind covers text, pictures, sounds, depth maps (distance), heat maps (temperature) and IMU signals (inertial navigation). At the same time, the neural network independently finds multisensory connections between objects as if a person were doing it.

That is, artificial intelligence is trained so that it can generate complete environments at the userâ€™s request. ImageBind connects objects and phenomena in photos and videos with how they may sound, how warm or cold they are, how they move and how they are located in three-dimensional space.

According to Metaâ€™s claims, in the future they will teach ImageBind artificial intelligence to process even more sensory information, including touch, speech, smell and even brain signals.

In the long run, everything sounds very cool. We are waiting for ImageBind to be tested personally to see for ourselves ðŸ‘Œ

In the meantime, you can test the capabilities of our SMMart AI system to generate full-fledged posts for social networks. In just a couple of clicks, you will receive a unique text along with a picture that matches it. The perfect tool for your business.
