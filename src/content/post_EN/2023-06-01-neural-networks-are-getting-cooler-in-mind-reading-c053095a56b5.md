The advertising created by neural networks was able to deceive marketing experts and, in general, turned out to be almost indistinguishable from human-created content.

The experiment, which measured the creativity of texts and the potential to stimulate emotional reactions, was conducted as part of the BrXnd marketing conference.

17 experts with a combined experience in advertising of about 300 years had to understand who the author of the advertisement was: a human or an artificial intelligence.

Seven advertisements were created by creative groups of marketing schools, and three were created by industry professionals using neural networks. Both marketing students and AI teams were asked to create an ad based on the description and logo of the fictional energy drink brand Volt. And the experts were able to determine the correct options with an accuracy of only 57%.

In addition, the advertising generated by artificial intelligence received an above average rating from the jury: 2.1 points out of 5.8 possible.

So creating high-quality advertising with the help of AI turned out to be not such a utopian task as it once seemed.

Who knows, maybe your next posts on social networks will also be generated by artificial intelligence? For example, using our [SMMart ](https://www.smm.art/)üòâ
