description: This article discusses MinD-Video, a neural network model created by researchers from the universities of Hong Kong and Singapore that creates a high-quality reconstruction of images seen by a person based on the activity of their brain. The article explains that MinD-Video has an accuracy of 85% in semantic classification and a structural similarity index of 0.19, which is 45% higher than other similar neural networks. The article also highlights the potential of mind-reading technology and promotes SMMart, an AI system that helps businesses promote their products and services on the internet using neural networks. Learn more about MinD-Video and the future of mind-reading technology in this article.

MinD-Video â€” artificial intelligence for getting detailed videos directly from the human brain ðŸ§ 

Another masterpiece from the world of AI was created by employees of the universities of Hong Kong and Singapore. They presented a neural network model that creates a high-quality reconstruction of images seen by a person based on the activity of his brain. That is, people were shown different videos during the MRI, and MinD-Video then recreates them. The custom version of Stable Diffusion helps in visualization.

The creators of this revolutionary neural network claim that its accuracy in semantic classification is 85%. To put it simply: here you have watched a video with a cat, and the neural network will unhindered restore this image with an average accuracy of 85%. As for the Structural similarity index (SSIM), which evaluates the degree of similarity of two images, here the indicator is 0.19. If we compare with the results of other similar neural networks (yes, there are such), the figure is as much as 45% higher.

According to the demos uploaded to the network, you yourself can draw a conclusion about the capabilities of MinD-Video artificial intelligence. At the same time, it scares and delights. Just imagine a future in which we will be able to communicate with the power of thought â€” with the help of this type of neurons ðŸ¤¯
