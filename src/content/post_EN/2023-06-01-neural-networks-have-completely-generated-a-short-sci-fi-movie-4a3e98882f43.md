description: This article discusses the collaboration of several neural networks to generate a short sci-fi film. The text-to-video model Gen-2 was responsible for the visual, the script was written in collaboration with the chat bot ChatGPT, the voiceover was synthesized by a text-to-speech algorithm from the ElevenLabs neural network, and background music was created with Mubert artificial intelligence. The article suggests that the use of artificial intelligence in generating films is becoming even closer than expected. The article also promotes SMMart, an AI system for generating high-quality content for businesses using neural networks.

On Twitter, the user TomLikesRobots presented an incredible 40-second Sci-Fi masterpiece, in the generation of which several neural networks participated at once.

The text-to-video model Gen-2 was responsible for the visual, the script was written in collaboration with the chat bot ChatGPT, the voiceover was synthesized by a text-to-speech algorithm from the ElevenLabs neural network, and background music was created with Mubert artificial intelligence.

It seems that the films generated from and to artificial intelligence are even closer than we all thought ðŸ”¥
