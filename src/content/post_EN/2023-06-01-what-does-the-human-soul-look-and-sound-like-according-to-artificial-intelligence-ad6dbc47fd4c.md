Artist Chris Kashtanova turned to several neural networks at once, including GMT-4, Midjourney, Kaiser AI, Maubert, RunwayML, so that they would help her depict the human soul.

First, Chris asked ChatGPT-4 to describe the soul. Then the resulting promt was driven into other neurons to generate an image, video and soundtrack based on it.

Chris shared the result on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1650627066780344324?s=61&t=zEBraNaPsU2KOl2sNou1HQ). It turned out cool and atmospheric. What do you think?
