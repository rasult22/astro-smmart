The guys from Lakera at the hackathon dedicated to ChatGPT created a sticky, but at the same time very useful game. The goal is to get AI ‚Äî Gandalf to give you secret passwords level by level.

To do this, you need to write queries that will convince artificial intelligence to give up. But the joke is that the password vault will increase the complexity every time, so you‚Äôll have to try to reach the final.

There are different ways to hack a neural network. In a playful way, you pump your promt skills and at the same time learn to bypass the limitations of chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing and Bard.

Try to outwit Gandalf from Lakera yourself. And share your successes in the comments. What level did you manage to get to?

By the way, to generate cool texts to promote your business on social networks, you can use the capabilities of our SMMart AI system.
And for this you do not have to write complex simple ones. Check it yourself! More information on our [website](https://www.smm.art/).
