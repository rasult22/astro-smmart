Nvidia is once again making a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence by introducing its new neural network Neuralangelo, which can generate 3D views from 2D. This opens up new horizons in areas that require detailed 3D models, such as video games, art and robotics.

So the transformation of 2D images into 3D scenes has become even more realistic and detailed thanks to this revolutionary technology. Nvidia emphasizes that their neural network Neuralangelo has a unique ability to transmit even the most complex textures and patterns of physical objects.

This is evident in Nvidia’s presentation video, where the neural network copes with modeling a variety of objects, ranging from Michelangelo’s marble statue of David to an ordinary truck. According to the developers, it takes about two hours to create a 3D model, depending on the complexity of the subject.

We are waiting for a full-fledged presentation of Neuralangelo by the whole Internet. They promise to hold it at the end of the month at a conference on computer vision and object recognition in Vancouver.

And while you’re waiting with us, you can test the power of neural networks for your business today. Our SMMart AI system, thanks to its unique matrix, generates relevant content for your successful online promotion. Find out more on our website at [this link](https://www.smm.art/).
