Instagram is testing an analogue of ChatGPT. So soon it will be possible to correspond with AI in direct üòè

One of the developers of Instagram, Alessandro Paluzzi, shared this news on Twitter. A chatbot with artificial intelligence will be able to answer questions and give advice to Instagram users. AI will help to write messages and, it seems, the neural network can be added to dialogues with other users.

By the way, this AI, apparently, will have 30 ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù. NeuroBilly Milligan, is that you?

It‚Äôs not very clear when exactly Instagram will deploy this feature with AI, but, as they say, there is no smoke without fire. After all, tools with artificial intelligence have long ceased to be something prohibitively impossible.

For example, our AI platform SMMart, which generates unique and high-quality content for your business. SMMart makes it easier for you to create posts. You save money and time, so you can concentrate on strategy and creativity. Profit üëå

Who knows, perhaps in the near future, the new Instagram chat assistant and our SMMart will become an indispensable combo for successful promotion in social networks.
