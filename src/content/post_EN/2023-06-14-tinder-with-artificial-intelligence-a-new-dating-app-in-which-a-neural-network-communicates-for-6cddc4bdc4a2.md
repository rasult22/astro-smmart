The Dispo development team has unveiled its new app â€” Teaser AI. At first glance, this is an ordinary dating application, but the whole trick is in personalized chat bots that conduct dialogues for users.

How does it work? When creating a profile, you fill out a questionnaire and thus train artificial intelligence. That is, you create your own chatbot, which will imitate your interests and personality when communicating. So if someone likes your profile, they will first communicate with your AI counterpart. And you will personally connect when the match happens and itâ€™s time to arrange a date ðŸ’«

So the developers wanted to help users move faster to real meetings, weeding out those who only want to correspond. But the main thing is the perfect protection against hosting.

If someone decides to suddenly disappear, you wonâ€™t even notice it â€” all communication up to this point is conducted by artificial intelligence, your chatbot.

Now imagine how neural networks help you not only to make a date, but also to promote your brand or business on the Internet. Sounds good, right?

Take a look at our [SMMart website](https://www.smm.art/) and find out how artificial intelligence can simplify not only your personal life, but also help in generating high-quality and cool content.
