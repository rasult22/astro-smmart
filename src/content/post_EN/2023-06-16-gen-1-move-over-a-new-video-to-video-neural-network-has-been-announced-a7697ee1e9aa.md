Engineers from Singapore‚Äôs Nanyang Technological University have developed a new technology in the field of artificial intelligence ‚Äî a neural network that is quite capable of competing with the popular Gen-1.

This, as yet unnamed, AI model offers a higher quality of video generation with minimal use of resources.‚ùóÔ∏è

Unlike many other models, the neural network strictly follows a given command, excluding unwanted improvisation, which often becomes the subject of criticism by users in Gen-1.

The neural network converts the video into a text-controlled video, allowing you to ‚Äúadjust‚Äù the images to the desired video. Everything happens in two stages: first, the model creates key frames, taking into account details like shape, texture and color, then these frames ‚Äúspread‚Äù to all other frames of the video üëÄ

So you can create high-quality videos with full stylistic and textural consistency. And no additional training or setup is required, which makes the process easier. The new AI model is also compatible with existing image processing techniques.

While the neural network code has not yet been published, but the developers promise to do it in the near future. If everything is as cool as at the demonstration, then the new video-to-video neural network can shake up the market quite well. üî•

And while everyone is waiting, today you can use the full power of neural networks to promote your products, services or personal brand on the Internet. Our assistant based on artificial intelligence SMMart generates high-quality and unique content on your request.
