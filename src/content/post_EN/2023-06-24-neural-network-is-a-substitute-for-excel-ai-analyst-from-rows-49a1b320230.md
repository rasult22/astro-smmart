The Rows data service presented its AI assistant, which works as a chatbot and easily performs a full-fledged analysis.

The neural network pulls data from the specified source, compiles a table and easily answers all questions. Try asking, “How much did we spend on coffee in a quarter?” and AI Analyst will immediately provide the exact number. Artificial intelligence from Rows is also able to track trends, identify hidden patterns in data, and much more.

And all this without much knowledge in analytics. The developers promise complete security of your data, because the information you share with the neural network is not stored on their servers.

And while you dive into the world of data analysis with AI Analyst, remember that the world of social networks can also be simplified. If you suddenly need to generate content for promotion on the Internet, check out the SMMart AI tool. Our neural network will do everything for you!
